# Use a directory on the file system as a remote cache.
# By default, Bazel has a build cache per workspace which keeps only the latest version
# of any target. Dish cache is useful for sharing build artifacts when switching branches
# and/or working on multiple workspaces of the same project, such as multiple checkouts.
#
# Since Bazel does not garbage-collect the directory,
# you might want to automate a periodic cleanup of this directory.
